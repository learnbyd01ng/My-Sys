<h2>Hands-on 3: valgrind</h2>

<p>
Complete the following hands-on assignment.  Do the activities
described, and submit your solutions using the <a href="https://6033.scripts.mit.edu:444/submit.cgi/">online submission site</a>
by 11:59p.

</p><p>This assignment relates to the Eraser paper, and exposes you to parallel
programming with Pthreads, and understanding and fixing concurrency errors.  You
might find it helpful to skim the Eraser paper, which is assigned for the next
section.  You also might want to refresh your memory on what race conditions are
and the troubles that they can cause by revisiting sections 5.2.2, 5.2.3, and
5.2.4 of the textbook.

</p><p>This assignment involves a small amount of programming.

</p><h4>I. Warmup</h4>

Add the 6.033 and gcc locker:
<pre>  no-knife:~&gt; add 6.033; add gcc
</pre>

Download the program <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/assignments/ph.c">ph.c</a> and store it in a file
<code>ph.c</code>. On a linux system, you might do:

<pre>  no-knife:~&gt; wget http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/assignments/ph.c
</pre>

Then compile and run it with one thread:
<pre>$ gcc -g -o ph ph.c -pthread
$ ./ph 1
completion time for put phase = 2.758351
0: 0 keys missing
completion time for get phase = 2.270119
</pre>

<p>The 1 specifies the number of threads that execute put and get operations on
the the hash table.  The program inserts <code>NKEYS</code> into a hash table in
the put phase and then looks them all up in the get phase.

</p><p>Let's run with 2 threads.  Then each thread does <code>NKEYS/2</code> puts in
the put phase and <code>NKEYS/2</code> lookups in the get phase.  The program is
written in C, the default language for low-level systems programming, and uses 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads">pthreads</a> for creating
several threads that can run in parallel if our machine has several cores
(most processors today have at least 2 cores).

</p><p>If we achieve perfect parallelism, then the two phases complete in half the
time.  Here is the output:

</p><pre>~/classes/6033-2013.git/wwwdocs/assignments$ ./ph 2
completion time for put phase = 1.688109
0: 27 keys missing
1: 39 keys missing
completion time for get phase = 3.215020
</pre>

<p>We see that put phase is faster now, so we were able to exploit 2 cores (but
it didn't get twice as fast).  The get phase, however, is slower with 2 cores,
which is disappointing: using more cores, the program ran slower.  More on that
later, because there is a bigger problem.

</p><p>You will likely observe that the code is incorrect. The application inserted
27+39 keys in phase 1 that phase 2 couldn't find. In your runs, there may be
more or fewer keys missing.  There may be even 0 keys missing in some runs.  If
you run with 1 thread, there will never be any keys missing.

</p><p>Run the application with 4 threads:
</p><pre>~/classes/6033-2013.git/wwwdocs/assignments$ ./ph 4
completion time for put phase = 1.113811
0: 39 keys missing
2: 31 keys missing
3: 15 keys missing
1: 37 keys missing
completion time for get phase = 3.436008
</pre> 

<p>Three points: 1) the put runs faster with 4 cores than 2 cores, but not 4
times as fast as a single core; 2) the get phase ran even slower; 3) more keys
are missing.

</p><h4>II. Using valgrind to find race condition</h4>

<p>The <code>ph.c</code> program is simple, and you may be able to spot the
mistake immediately, but we will use a tool, <code>helgrind</code> that helps 
us find such errors automatically. <code>helgrind</code> is similar in spirit to
the Eraser system that you are reading about, and is part of a suite of tools
collectively called <code>valgrind</code>.

</p><p>Run <code>helgrind</code> with <code>ph</code>. You will see output as follows:
</p><pre>$ valgrind --tool=helgrind ./ph 2

<p><b>Question 1:</b> Study <code>helgrind</code>'s output and the
<code>ph.c</code> program.  Clearly something is wrong with <code>put()</code>
on line 61.  Why are there missing keys with 2 or more threads, but not with 1
thread?  Identify a sequence of events that can lead to keys missing for 2
threads.

</p><h4>Fixing the error</h4>

<p></p><p>To avoid this sequence of events, insert lock and unlock statements in
<code>put</code> so that the number keys missing is always 0.  The relevant
pthread calls are (for more see the manual pages, man pthread):

</p><pre>pthread_mutex_t lock;     // declare a lock
pthread_mutex_init(&amp;lock, NULL);   // initialize the lock
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;lock);  // acquire lock
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;lock);  // release lock
</pre>

<p>The function <code>get()</code> has an example use of locks, and
<code>main</code> initializes it.

</p><p>Modify <code>ph.c</code> to make it correct and recompile with gcc. Test your 
code first with 1 thread, then test it with 2 threads.  Is it correct (i.e. have 
you eliminated missing keys)?  Check the correctness using <code>helgrind</code>.  
(Note that valgrind slows down <code>ph</code> a lot, so you may want to modify 
NKEYS to be some small number.)

</p><p><b>Question 2:</b> Describe your changes and argue why these changes ensure
correctness.

</p><p><b>Question 3:</b> Is the two-threaded version faster than the single-threaded
version in the put phase?  Report the running times for the two-threaded version
and the single-threaded version. (Make sure to undo your NKEYS change.)

</p><p><b>Question 4:</b> Most likely (depending on your exact changes)
<code>ph</code> won't achieve any speedup.  Why is that?

</p><h4>Living dangerously</h4>

<p>Remove the locks from <code>get()</code> in <code>ph.c</code>, recompile, and
rerun the program.

</p><p><b>Question 5:</b> You should observe speedup on several cores for the
<code>get</code> phase of <code>ph</code>.  Why is that?

</p><p><b>Question 6:</b> Why does <code>valgrind</code> report no errors for <code>get()</code>?

</p><h4>Challenge</h4>

<p><b>Question 7:</b> Can you think of a way of modifying <code>ph.c</code> so that you get speedup
for <i>both</i> phases and <code>valgrind</code> won't report race conditions?  (If you
have time, implement that plan and check.)
