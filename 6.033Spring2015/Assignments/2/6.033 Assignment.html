<h4><i>MIT EECS - 6.033</i></h4></a>

<h4>Assignment</h4>

<p> Read <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/papers/therac.pdf"><i>Medical Devices: The
Therac-25</i></a> by Leveson (which is an updated version of <i>An
Investigation of the Therac-25 Accidents</i> by Leveson and Turner).
Although there are many cases in which software design and failure has
led to the loss of life, the case of the Therac-25 is among the best
known and most widely cited because of the depth of analysis that was
performed by professor Nancy Leveson and her graduate student Clark
Turner.

</p><p>The Leveson paper is quite long, and not all parts are equally
important:

</p><ul>
<li> Skim Sections 1 and 2.  You should understand the basics of the
  Therac-25's design and how it was used.  (You may also
  find <a href="http://radonc.wikidot.com/local--files/radiation-accident-therac25/Therac25.png">this
  figure</a> a helpful accompaniment to Figure 1 on page 4.)
</li><li> Skim Sections 3.1-3.3, which detail a few of the Therac-25
  incidents.
</li><li> Read Sections 3.4 and 3.5.  These detail a particular incident,
  the software bug that led to it, and the response to the bug.  Pay
  close attention to 3.5.3, which describes the bug.
</li><li> Skip Section 3.6.  (It describes an additional incident and a different
  bug—feel free to read if you are interested, though)
</li><li> Read Section 4 closely.
</li></ul>

<h4>Reading Tips</h4>

<p>This assignment is a good opportunity for you to begin practicing
how to get the interesting stuff out of a paper without getting bogged
down in minor detail:

</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Start with a quick pass, just reading the section headings and the
figure captions, to get an idea of the layout of the paper and what
kinds of things the authors seem to be trying to communicate.

</li><li>Next, skim it quickly, looking primarily at the first and last
paragraph of each section.
</li></ul>

<p>As you read the paper, try to distinguish solid technical facts from
higher-level statements that the authors are trying to make about
process, procedures and policy. You might find it useful to note the
places where you agree or disagree with the authors' analysis.

</p><p>Finally, don't be dismayed by unfamiliar technical jargon; make a
guess about what it means and move on.  The authors may explain it two
paragraphs later, or two pages later, or perhaps never get around to
it.  There is a good chance that you will discover that it didn't
actually matter.  But if it does, you have something to ask about in
recitation.

</p><h4>Question for Recitation</h4>

<p>Before you come to recitation on Thursday, write up (on paper) an
answer to the following: <b>Name three quality control procedures that
might have made a difference, as demonstrated in the examples.</b>
