<h2>
Hands-on 7: Write Ahead Log System
</h2>

<h3>Intro to wal-sys</h3> 

<p>
Complete the following hands-on assignment. Do the
activities described, and submit your solutions using the <a href="https://6033.scripts.mit.edu:444/submit.cgi/">online submission
site</a> before 11:59p.

</p><p>This hands-on assignment will give you
some experience using a Write Ahead Log (WAL) system.  This system
corresponds to the WAL scheme described in Section 9.3 of the textbook.
You should carefully read that section before attempting this
assignment.  You can do this hands-on on any computer that has a Python
language interpreter, but we will be able to answer your questions
more easily if you run this on an Athena workstation.

You can download the WAL system from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/assignments/wal-sys.py">here</a> (if
your browser displays the file in a window instead of saving it, use
"File -&gt; Save As" to save the file).  The downloaded file is a Python
script named <i>wal-sys</i>. Before trying to run it, change its
permissions to make it executable, for example by typing:


</p>
<blockquote>
  <b><code>athena% chmod +x wal-sys.py</code></b>
</blockquote>

<p>The <i>wal-sys</i> script can be run as follows:
</p><blockquote>
<b><code>athena% ./wal-sys.py [-reset]</code></b>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, you can run the script as:</p><blockquote>

<b><code>athena% python ./wal-sys.py [-reset]</code></b></blockquote>

<p><i>Wal-sys</i> is a simple WAL system that models a bank's central
database, implementing redo logging for error-recovery. <i>Wal-sys</i>
creates and uses two files, named LOG and DB, in the current working
directory. The "LOG" file contains the log entries, and the "DB" file
contains all of the installed changes to the database.  </p>

<p> After you start <i>wal-sys</i>, you can enter commands to manage
recoverable actions and accounts. There are also commands to simulate a system
crash and to print the contents of the "LOG" and "DB" files. All the commands
to <i>wal-sys</i> are case sensitive. Since <i>wal-sys</i> uses the standard
input stream, you can use the system in batch mode. To do this, place your
commands in a file ("cmd.in" for example) and redirect the file to
<i>wal-sys</i>'s standard input:<br>

</p><blockquote>
  <b><code>athena% ./wal-sys.py -reset &lt; cmd.in</code></b>.
</blockquote>
<p>When using batch mode, make sure that each command is followed by a
newline character (including the last one).</p>

When you restart <i>wal-sys</i>, it will perform a log-based recovery
of the "DB" file using the "LOG" file it finds in the current working
directory. The <b>-reset</b> option tells <i>wal-sys</i> to discard
the contents of any previous "DB" and "LOG" files so that it can start
with a clean initial state.


<h3>Commands interpreted by wal-sys</h3>

The following commands are used for managing recoverable actions and
accounts: <p></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>

    <li><p><b><code>begin action_id</code></b><br>Begin a recoverable action
    denoted by <i>action_id</i>.  The <i>action_id</i> is a positive integer
    that uniquely identifies a given recoverable action.</p></li>

    <li><p><b><code>create_account action_id account_name
    starting_balance</code></b><br>Create a new account with the given
    <i>account_name</i> and <i>starting_balance</i>. The first
    argument specifies that this operation is part of recoverable
    action <i>action_id</i>. The <i>account_name</i> can be any
    character string with no white spaces.</p></li>

    <li><p><b><code>credit_account action_id account_name
    credit_amount</code></b><br>Add <i>credit_amount</i> to
    <i>account_name</i>'s balance.  This command logs the credit and
    holds it in a buffer until an <b><code>end</code></b> command is
    executed for recoverable action <i>action_id</i>.</p></li>
    
    <li> <p><b><code>debit_account action_id account_name
    debit_amount</code></b><br>Reduce <i>account_name</i>'s balance by
    <i>debit_amount</i>.  Like <b><code>credit</code></b>, this
    command logs the debit and holds it in a buffer until an
    <b><code>end</code></b> command is executed for recoverable action
    <i>action_id</i>.</p></li>
    
    <li> <p><b><code>commit action_id</code></b><br>Commit the
      recoverable action <i>action_id</i>.  This command logs a commit
      record.</p> </li><li> <p><b><code>checkpoint</code></b><br>Log a
      checkpoint record.</p> </li><li> <p><b><code>end
      action_id</code></b><br>End recoverable action <i>action_id</i>.
      This command installs the results of recoverable action
      <i>action_id</i> to the "DB".  It also logs an end record.</p>
    </li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following commands help us understand the dynamics of the WAL system:
</p>

<blockquote> <ul>

    <li> <p><b><code>show_state</code></b><br>Print out
    the current state of the database.  This command displays the
    contents of the "DB" and "LOG" files.</p></li>
    
    <li> <p><b><code>crash</code></b><br>Crash the system.  In
     this hands-on, we are only concerned about crash recovery, so
     this is the only command we will use to exit the program.</p>
     </li> </ul> </blockquote>

<h3>Using wal-sys</h3>
Start <i>wal-sys</i> with a reset: 

<blockquote>
<b><code>athena% ./wal-sys.py -reset</code></b><br>
</blockquote>
and run the following commands (sequence 1):

<blockquote>
<b><code>begin 1</code></b><br>
<b><code>create_account 1 studentA 1000</code></b><br>
<b><code>commit 1</code></b><br>
<b><code>end 1</code></b><br>
<b><code>begin 2</code></b><br>
<b><code>create_account 2 studentB 2000</code></b><br>

<b><code>begin 3</code></b><br>
<b><code>create_account 3 studentC 3000</code></b><br>
<b><code>credit_account 3 studentC 100</code></b><br>
<b><code>debit_account 3 studentA 100</code></b><br>
<b><code>commit 3</code></b><br>
<b><code>show_state</code></b><br>
<b><code>crash</code></b><br>
</blockquote>

<i>Wal-sys</i> should print out the contents of the "DB" and "LOG"
files, and then exit.


<p>Use a text editor to examine the "DB" and "LOG" files and answer
the following questions (do not run <i>wal-sys</i> again until you
have answered these questions): </p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Question 1:</b> <i>Wal-sys</i>
displays the current state of the database contents after you type
<b><code>show_state</code></b>. Why doesn't the database show
<i>studentB</i>?</p>

<p><b>Question 2:</b> When the database recovers, which accounts
should be active, and what values should they contain?  </p>

<p><b>Question 3:</b> Can you explain why the "DB" file does not
contain a record for
<i>studentC</i> and contains the pre-debit balance for
<i>studentA</i>?
</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Recovering the database</h3> When you run <i>wal-sys</i> without
the <b><code>-reset</code></b> option it recovers the database "DB"
using the "LOG" file. To recover the database and then look at the
results, type: <blockquote> <b><code>athena% ./wal-sys.py</code></b><br>
<b><code>&gt; show_state</code></b><br> <b><code>&gt; crash</code></b><br>

</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Question 4:</b> What do you expect the state of "DB" to be
after <i>wal-sys</i> recovers? Why?  </p>

<p><b>Question 5:</b> Run <i>wal-sys</i> again
to recover the database. Examine the "DB" file. Does the state of the
database match your expectations? Why or why not?  </p>

<p><b>Question 6:</b> During
recovery, <i>wal-sys</i> reports the <i>action_id</i>s of those
recoverable actions that are "Losers", "Winners", and "Done".  What is
the meaning of these categories?</p>

</blockquote>

 
<h3>Checkpoints</h3>

Start <i>wal-sys</i> with a reset:
<blockquote>
<b><code>athena% ./wal-sys.py -reset</code></b><br>
</blockquote>
and run the following commands (sequence 2):
<blockquote>
<b><code>begin 1</code></b><br>
<b><code>create_account 1 studentA 1000</code></b><br>

<b><code>commit 1</code></b><br>
<b><code>end 1</code></b><br>
<b><code>begin 2</code></b><br>
<b><code>create_account 2 studentB 2000</code></b><br>
<b><code>checkpoint</code></b><br>
<b><code>begin 3</code></b><br>
<b><code>create_account 3 studentC 3000</code></b><br>
<b><code>credit_account 3 studentC 100</code></b><br>
<b><code>debit_account 2 studentB 100</code></b><br>

<b><code>commit 3</code></b><br> <b><code>show_state</code></b><br>
<b><code>crash</code></b><br> </blockquote> <b>Note:</b> the remainder
of this assignment is only concerned with sequence 2.  We will ask you
to crash and recover the system a few times, but you should not run
the sequence commands again. (Also note that in sequence 2, the
command <b>debit_account 2 studentB 100</b> refers to action_id 2,
not action_id 3!  This is not a typo).

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 7:</b> Why are the results of recoverable action
2's <b><code>create_account 2 studentB 2000</code></b> command not
installed in "DB" by the <b><code>checkpoint</code></b> command on the
following line?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Examine the "LOG" output file.  In particular, inspect the
CHECKPOINT entry.  Also, count the number of entries in the "LOG"
file.  Run <i>wal-sys</i> again to recover the database.

</p><blockquote>
<p><b>Question 8:</b> How many lines were rolled back?  What is the
advantage of using checkpoints?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note down the
<i>action_id</i>s of "Winners", "Losers", and "Done".  Use the
<b><code>show_state</code></b> command to look at the recovered
database and verify that the database recovered correctly.  Crash the
system, and then run <i>wal-sys</i> again to recover the database a
second time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 9:</b> Does the second run of the recovery procedure
(for sequence 2) restore "DB" to the same state as the first run?
What is this property called?</p>

<p><b>Question 10</b>: Compare the <i>action_id</i>s of
"Winners", "Losers", and "Done" from the second recovery with those
from the first.  The lists are different.  How does the recovery
procedure guarantee the property from Question 9 even though the
recovery procedure can change? (Hint: Examine the "LOG" file).</p>

<p><b>Optional:</b> Wal-sys has a hitherto unmentioned option: if you type
<b><code>wal-sys -undo</code></b> it will perform undo logging and
undo recovery.  Try the above sequences again with undo logging to see
what changes.</p>
