<h2>Hands-on 6: Understanding TCP using tcpdump</h2>



<p>
Complete the following hands-on assignment. As usual, submit your solutions using
the <a href="https://6033.scripts.mit.edu:444/submit.cgi/">online submission site</a> by 11:59p.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>
We recommend, but do not require, that you perform this assignment on
Athena. Please note that the TAs cannot guarantee tech support if you
do not use an Athena workstation. Before you begin the assignment,
please verify the following:<br>
</p><ol>
<li>
<b> tcpdump is installed </b>: Most athena workstations (and linux
machines, in general) should have tcpdump installed by default. If you
get the error 'tcpdump: Command not found.', on an athena machine, run:
<blockquote><code>
 athena% <font color="green">add ops</font>
</code></blockquote>

If you are using other linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based) machines, run:
<blockquote><code>sudo apt-get install tcpdump</code></blockquote> 
to install it for the duration of a login session. 
</li>
<li>
<b> <a id="x11">X11 forwarding (ssh -X) is enabled</a> </b>: This
step is required only if you are accessing the athena machine (or any
linux machine) over ssh. Please ensure that you enable X11 forwarding
with "ssh -X". This is required for plotting the time sequence graph
using xplot (section <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/assignments/handson-tcp.html#sec1">1</a>). For example, to ssh into
the athena dialup machine run:
<blockquote><code>ssh -X athena.dialup.mit.edu</code></blockquote> X11
forwarding is available on most linux machines and Mac OS X until
Mountain Lion (<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5293">X11 on
Mountain Lion</a>). X11 forwarding post-Mountain Lion can be done with
<a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">XQuartz</a>.  We do
not recommend or support X11 forwarding from Windows, but the
following <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/misc/xwindows.html">link</a>
may be useful.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In this assignment you will understand how TCP works using tcpdump. To
begin with, download the tcpdump log file
from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/assignments/tcpdump.dat">here</a>. You
can also download it on any linux machine using:
</p>

<blockquote><code>
 athena% <font color="green">wget http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/assignments/tcpdump.dat</font>
</code></blockquote>


<h3>
<b>0. Understanding tcpdump</b>
</h3>

<p> For this assignment, we used a program that transmits a file from
a machine called <i>willow</i> to a machine called <i>maple</i> over a
TCP connection. We ran the <i>tcpdump</i> tool on the sender, willow,
to log both the departing data packets and the received
acknowledgments (ACKs).
</p>

<p>
The file tcpdump.dat is a binary file which contains a log of all the
TCP packets for the above TCP connection. The file is not
human-readable. To parse the file, you can use tcpdump. For
more information on tcpdump, you can look at:
</p>  


<blockquote><code>
  athena% <font color="green">man tcpdump</font>
</code></blockquote>

<p>
To understand the log file in a human-readable format, run:
</p>

<blockquote><code>   
 athena% <font color="green">tcpdump -r tcpdump.dat &gt; outfile.txt </font>
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Now open outfile.txt on your preferred text editor. The output has
several lines listing packets sent from willow to maple, and the ACKs
from maple to willow. For example:
</p>

<blockquote><code>   
00:34:41.474225 IP willow.csail.mit.edu.39675 &gt; maple.csail.mit.edu.5001: Flags [.], seq 1473:2921, ack 1, win 115, options [nop,nop,TS val 282136474 ecr 282202089], length 1448
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Denotes a packet sent from willow to maple. TCP uses <i>sequence
numbers</i> to keep track of how much data it has sent. This packet
has a sequence number 1473:2921, indicating that it contains all bytes
from byte # 1473 to byte # 2920 (= 2921 - 1) in the stream, which is a
total of 1448 bytes (note that 1448 = 2921 - 1473). The time stamp
00:34:41.474225 denotes the time at which the packet was transmitted
by willow.
</p>

<p>
(<b>Note:</b> There may be very minor variations in the format of the
output of tcpdump depending on the version of tcpdump on your machine.)
</p>

<p>
Once maple receives the packet, assuming that it has received all
previous packets as well, it sends an acknowledgment (ACK):
</p>

<blockquote><code>   
00:34:41.482047 IP maple.csail.mit.edu.5001 &gt; willow.csail.mit.edu.39675: Flags [.], ack 2921, win 159, options [nop,nop,TS val 282202095 ecr 282136474], length 0
</code></blockquote>

<p> This indicates that maple has received all bytes from byte # 0 to
byte # 2920. The next byte # that maple expects is byte # 2921. The
time stamp 00:34:41.482047, denotes the time at which the ACK was
received by willow.
</p>


<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 1:</b> What are the IP addresses of maple and willow on
this network? (Hint: Check the man page of tcpdump to discover how you
can obtain the IP addresses)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 2:</b> How many kilobytes were transferred during this
TCP session, and how long did it last? Based on these, what is the
throughput (in KiloBytes/sec) of this TCP flow between willow and maple?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 3:</b> What is the round-trip time (RTT) in seconds,
between willow and maple, based on packet 1473:2921 and its
acknowledgment?  Look at outfile.txt and find the round-trip time of
packet 13057:14505. Why are the two values different?
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<b><a id="sec1">1. Time Sequence Graph</a></b>
</h3>

The time sequence graph plots the sequence numbers of packets and
their acknowledgments over time. The xplot time sequence graph for
the tcpdump data file (tsg.xpl) is available <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/assignments/tsg.xpl">here</a>. You can
also download it on any linux machine using:
<p></p>

<blockquote><code>
 athena% <font color="green">wget http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/assignments/tsg.xpl</font>
</code></blockquote>

<p>
To plot a time sequence graph of the tcpdump data you need xplot. To
make it available on Athena machines, run the following command:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote> <code>
athena% <font color="green">add sipbnet</font>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
(<b>Note:</b> In case you prefer to use your own linux machine, xplot is
available at for download at <a href="http://www.xplot.org/">www.xplot.org</a>.
Please do <b>not</b> install the package "xplot" on Ubuntu machines. The
correct version of xplot is in the Ubuntu repository as "xplot.org", and can be
installed with "apt-get install xplot.org". To display the plot in this case,
run "xplot.org tsg.xpl". Please note that the TAs cannot guarantee tech support
if you do not use an Athena machine.)
</p>

<p>
Now you should be able to obtain the plot using:
</p>

<p>
</p><blockquote><code>
athena% <font color="green">xplot tsg.xpl </font>
</code></blockquote> 
<p></p>

<p>
(<b>Note:</b> In case you get the following error message: "fatal
error: could not open display", you have probably not enabled X11
forwarding for ssh. Please check the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/assignments/handson-tcp.html#x11">X11 forwarding
section</a> above)
</p>

<p>
At this point, You should obtain a graph similar to the one in the
figure below. Xplot allows you to zoom in / zoom out onto different
portions of the figure:
</p><ul>
<li> <b>To zoom in:</b>  Drag a rectangle with the left mouse button. 
</li><li> <b>To zoom out:</b> Click the left mouse button. 
</li><li> <b>To scroll:</b>   Drag with the middle mouse button.
</li></ul>
<p></p>

If you need additional information on xplot, visit
the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~jeffay/dirt/FAQ/xplot.html">xplot
FAQ page</a>.

<img width="" height="450" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./6.033_ Hands-on Assignment (TCP)_files/tsg1.png" alt="Image tsg1">
</div>



<p>
The graph shows the number of bytes transmitted so far as a function
of the time (in seconds). The time is taken from the tcpdump
timestamp. The plotting program expresses the full time, in hh:mm:ss
every second, and shows only the seconds in-between.
</p>
<p>
The graph depicts different quantities:
</p><ul>
<li> <b> White arrows: </b> Each white arrow represents one sent
packets. For example, the packet with sequence number 1473:2921 sent
at 00:34:41.474225 is represented as a white arrow located at
00:34:41.474225 on the x-axis, starting from 1473 and ending at 2921
on the y-axis. </li>
<li> <b> Green lines: </b> The green represents the acknowledgments
(ACKs). Specifically, every transition refers to an arrival of an ACK
at willow. For example, the ACK 2921 received by willow at time
00:34:41.482047 is represented by a transition at 00:34:41.482047 on
the x-axis and 2921 on the y-axis.
</li><li> <b> Red arrows (marked with R): </b> Each red arrow represents a
retransmitted packet.
</li></ul>

For additional information, a detailed manual on the various aspects
of this plot is
available <a href="http://www.tcptrace.org/tcptrace-manual/manual/index.html">here</a>.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 4:</b> You may notice that the white arrows occur
always close to a "transition" in the green line. Do they occur to the
left (i.e. before) or to the right of (i.e. after) these transitions?
Why do you think this is the case?
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<b>2. Packet Loss and Retransmission</b>
</h3>
<p>
When a packet is lost, the transmitter does not receive an
acknowledgment for it. You may recall that the lecture on TCP
described two mechanisms by which a sender identifies a packet loss:
three duplicate ACKs, or timeout. Answer the following questions on
packet loss by zooming-in on the xplot graph. 

</p><blockquote>
<p><b>Question 5:</b> Find the <i>lowest</i> sequence number of a
packet which was re-transmitted after 3 duplicate ACKs. You are
permitted to round the sequence number to the nearest 1000 (e.g. you
can say 13000:15000 instead of 13057:14505).
</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 6:</b> Find the <i>lowest</i> sequence number of a
packet which was re-transmitted after a time-out. You are permitted to
round the sequence number to the nearest 1000.
</p>
</blockquote>


<h3>
<b>3. TCP Congestion Control</b>
</h3>


Zoom-out and look at the xplot graph for the whole transfer. You will
notice that for most of the duration of the transfer (ignoring loss
and initial behavior), the transmitted sequence numbers (i.e. the
white arrows) appear to be on a line.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 7:</b> What aspect of TCP's behavior causes these white
arrows to lie approximately on a line?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 8:</b> Can you provide an equation that relates the
slope of the above line to the average congestion window size (in
Bytes) and the average round-trip time (RTT) of the TCP connection?
</p>
</blockquote>


<h3>
<b>4. Capacity and Congestion Control (Optional) </b>
</h3>

<p>
A sender and receiver are connected by multiple links in the
network. Each link may have a different capacity. The maximum capacity
of the path between the sender and receiver is dictated by the link
with least capacity (i.e. the bottleneck link).
</p>

<p> Packet pair is a technique for estimating the bottleneck capacity
of a path. The packet-pair technique transmits two packets
back-to-back from the transmitter to the receiver. These packets
traverse a series of links connecting the source to destination. Note
that for any such link with a link capacity is C Bytes/s, the span of
a packet of length B bytes on the link equals B/C seconds. For
example, in the figure below, t<sub>b</sub>, is the span of the packet
on the bottleneck link. </p>

<div class="centerline" id="par3299" align="CENTER" style="padding:25px">
<img width="" height="250pt" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./6.033_ Hands-on Assignment (TCP)_files/packetpair.png" alt="Image packet-pair">
</div>



<p>
Note that when you send two packets back-to-back, the inter-packet
spacing will be defined by the bottleneck link, as shown in the
figure.  Hence, measuring the inter-arrival time (i.e. the time
between the beginning of the two packets) at the receiver, provides a
good estimate of the capacity of the bottleneck link.  Note that
though the bottleneck link will be followed by a link with higher
capacity, this new link preserves the bottleneck spacing between the
two packets. (Think why this is the case!)
</p>


<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 9 (Optional):</b> For the path between willow and
maple, the median inter-arrival time for a packet pair was estimated
to be 0.0013 seconds. Each packet in the packet pair contained 1500
Bytes. What is the bottleneck capacity of the path (in KiloBytes/sec)
between willow and maple, based on this inter-arrival time?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 10 (Optional):</b> Give a potential reason why the
throughput of the TCP connection, estimated in Question 2, is
different from the capacity of the bottleneck link.
</p>
