  Control and Recovery</p> 

<p>
Read <a href="http://db.lcs.mit.edu/6.893/F04/ccandr.pdf"><i>Concurrency
Control and Recovery</i></a>, by Michael J. Franklin.  You can
skip section 3.2.

</p><p> This paper is quite long, so you may want to digest the paper in a
few chunks.  The first two sections are a good review of the basics of
locking and logging that will be discussed in lectures this week.

</p><p>
<b>After reading the paper, answer the following question</b>: </p>

<p>The end of Section 1 presents the challenge of achieving isolation and
  fault tolerance while still maintaining good performance.  One
  example of this trade-off is in choosing the buffer management
  policy: a NO-STEAL/FORCE policy is the easiest to implement, but
  STEAL/NO-FORCE results in the best performance.

</p><p>Give at least three additional examples from the paper that
  illustrate the trade-off between implementing ACID transaction
  properties and maintaining good performance.  For each example,
  explain how the policy or technique in question trades off
  performance.
