<h2>Hands-on 5: Internet Routes and Measuring Round Trip Times</h2>

<p>
<b>Note:</b><br> 
Some students have reported having problems with running the traceroute command on the Debathena cluster machines. If you get the error 'traceroute: Command not found.', run the command
<br>
</p>

<p>
</p><blockquote><code>sudo apt-get install traceroute</code></blockquote> 
<p></p>

<p>
to install it for the duration of a login session. Another option is ssh'ing into linux.mit.edu and then running the traceroute command.
</p>

<p>
Complete the following hands-on assignment. 
As usual, submit your solutions using
the <a href="https://6033.scripts.mit.edu:444/submit.cgi/">online submission site</a> by 11:59p.
</p>

<p>
In this assignment you will get a chance to experiment with two very
useful and widely-used network diagnostic tools,
<code>traceroute</code> and <code>ping</code>, to expose you to some of
the interesting quirks in network routing and packet round trip
times. 
</p>

<p>
We recommend, but do not require, that you perform this assignment on
Athena.  Please note that the TAs cannot guarantee tech support if you do not
use an Athena workstation.  In either case, please make sure you use a
workstation on the MIT network.  Some results may be quite different
if you use an off-campus network.
</p>


<h3>
<b>0. Measuring Round Trip Times With Ping</b>
</h3>

<p>
In the first two exercises, you will use the ping utility to send
echo requests to a number of different hosts.  The ping utility is one of
the more useful utilities for testing a network.  It allows
you to measure the time that it takes for a packet to travel through
the Internet to a remote host and back.  The ping utility works
by sending a short message, called an <i>echo-request</i>, to a host using
the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).  A
host that supports ICMP (and most do) and receives an echo-request
message simply replies by sending an
<i>echo-response</i> back to the originating host.
</p>

<p> In many of the exercises, you will be referring to hosts via their
DNS names rather than their IP addresses. (For more information about
Internet hostnames and DNS, and how these relate to IP addresses, please
see Section 4.4 of the course notes.) </p>

<p>
For more information about ping, look at the man page on ping and the
specifications for ICMP, located in 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0792.txt">RFC 792</a>.
Section 7.13.4 of the course notes describes ICMP as well.
</p>  


<blockquote><code>
  athena% <font color="green">man ping</font>
</code></blockquote>

<p>
To use the ping command on Athena, run a command such as:
</p>

<blockquote><code>   
 athena% <font color="green">ping www.google.com</font>
</code></blockquote>

<p>
If you run ping from a Sun workstation, you may have to use the <code>-s</code>
option to get it to display the results that you want.  Type
<code>machtype</code> to determine the type of machine you are using.
If you have any more questions, see the man pages for more details
on how to use ping.
</p>

<h4>
<b>A. Round Trip Times:</b>
</h4>

<p> In the following two questions, you are asked to use the ping
utility to measure the round trip times to several hosts on the
Internet. </p>

<p>
For the following hosts, send 10 packets, each with a length
of 56 data bytes.  <i>Note</i>: You may find that the packet responses are 64
bytes instead of 56 bytes.  Look at 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0792.txt">RFC 792</a> to find
 out the reason.
</p>

<p>
The hosts are:
</p>
<pre>www.csail.mit.edu       
www.berkeley.edu 
www.unsw.edu.au
www.kyoto-u.ac.jp
</pre>


<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 1:</b>
Indicate what percentage of packets sent resulted in a
successful response.  For the packets from which you received a
response, write down the minimum, average, and maximum round trip
times in milliseconds.  Note that ping reports these times to you
if you tell it how many packets to send on the command line.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 2:</b>  
Explain the differences in minimum round 
trip time to each of these hosts.
</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p><b>Question 3:</b>  
Now send pings with 56, 512 and 1024 byte packets to the 4 hosts above. Write down the minimum, average,
and maximum round trip times in milliseconds for each of the 12 pings. 
Why are the minimum round-trip times to the same hosts different
when using 56, 512, and 1024 byte packets?
</p>
</blockquote>



<h4>
<b>B. Unanswered Pings:</b>
</h4>

<p>
For the following hosts, send 100 packets that have a length of
56 data bytes.  Indicate what percentage of the packets resulted in a
successful response.  <!-- For the packets that you received a response,
write down the minimum, average, and maximum round trip times in
milliseconds. -->
</p>

<pre>www.wits.ac.za         (University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg)
www.microsoft.com 
</pre>

<blockquote> <p><b>Question 4:</b> For some of the hosts, you may not
have received any responses for the packets you sent.  What are some
reasons as to why you might have not gotten a response? (Be sure to
check the hosts in a web browser.)  </p> </blockquote>


<h3>
<b>1. Understanding Internet routes using traceroute</b>
</h3>

<p>
As the name implies, <code>traceroute</code> essentially allows you to
trace the entire route from your machine to a remote machine. The remote
machine can be specified either as a name or as an IP address.
</p>

<p>
We include a sample output of an execution of traceroute and
explain the salient features. The command:<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<code>   
 % <font color="green">traceroute www.google.com</font>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
tries to determine the path from the source machine
(<code>vinegar-pot.mit.edu</code>) to <code>www.google.com</code>. The
machine encountered on the path after the first hop is
<code>NW12-RTR-2-SIPB.MIT.EDU</code>, the next is
<code>EXTERNAL-RTR-1-BACKBONE-2.MIT.EDU</code>, and so on. In all, it takes 13 hops
to reach <code>py-in-f99.google.com</code>. The man page for
traceroute (<code> athena% <font color="green">man traceroute</font>
</code>) contains explanations for the remaining fields on each line.

<h4>
<b>A. Basics:</b>
</h4>


<blockquote><p>
<b>Question 5:</b>
</p><p>In at most 50 words, explain how traceroute discovers a path to
a remote host. The man page might be useful in answering this question.
</p></blockquote>

<h4>
<b>B. Routine Asymmetries:</b>
</h4>

<p>
For this exercise, you need to use the traceroute server
at <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/nph-traceroute.pl">http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/nph-traceroute.pl</a>.
When you view this web page, execute a traceroute (trace) to your
machine (run <code>/sbin/ifconfig</code> to find the IP Address of your machine).  Run your local traceroute to whatever server Stanford tells you it is running traceroute from for this question. 
<b>Note</b>: It is important to run this on an Athena machine. If the Stanford traceroute does not work, or if you get no reply after 2--3 minutes, you should try one of the other looking glass servers on this page:

<a href="http://www.traceroute.org/#Looking%20Glass">http://www.traceroute.org/#Looking%20Glass </a>

If you use a different server, make sure that you note in your hands-on that you used a different server than the question asked for. 
</p>

<p>
Now run this on your machine:
</p><code>athena% <font color="green">traceroute www1.slac.stanford.edu</font> 
</code><br>
<p></p>


<blockquote><p>
<b>Question 6:</b>
Show the output of traceroute from each direction above.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
<b>Question 7:</b>
Describe anything unusual about the output. Are the
same routers traversed in both directions?  If not, why might this happen?
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>
<b>C. Blackholes:</b>
</h4>

<p>
At the command prompt, type:
</p>
<code> athena% <font color="green">traceroute 18.31.0.200</font>
</code>

<blockquote><p>
<b>Question 8:</b> 
Show the output of the above command.  Describe
what is strange about the observed output, and why traceroute gives
you such an output.  Refer to the traceroute man page for useful
hints.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<b>2. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</b>
</h3>

<p>For this last question on the topic of Internet routing, you need
to refer to the BGP routing table data below.  This table shows all of 
the BGP routing entries that a particular router (near the University of 
Oregon) refers to when forwarding
any packets to MIT (IP Address 18.*.*.*).  
</p>

<p>
As described in the Internet
routing paper, recall that BGP is a path vector protocol.  
Each line of this table lists a distinct path from this router
to MIT, from which it will choose one to use.
The <code>Next Hop</code> field is the IP address of the router that
forwards packets for each path listed in the table.
The <code>Path</code> field is the list of autonomous systems the path
traverses on its way to MIT.
The other fields (<code>Metric, LocPrf, Weight</code>) may be used by the router to
decide which one of the possible paths to use. 
</p>

<pre>BGP table version is 9993576, local router ID is 198.32.162.100
