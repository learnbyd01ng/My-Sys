<p></p><h4>Introduction </h4><p></p>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with the
concepts of process control and signalling. You'll do this by writing
a simple Unix shell program that supports job control. </p>

<hr>

 <p></p><h4>General Overview of Unix Shells </h4><p></p>

 <p>A <em>shell </em>is an interactive command-line interpreter that
    runs programs on behalf of the user. A shell repeatedly prints a
    prompt, waits for a <em>command line </em>on stdin, and then
    carries out some action, as directed by the contents of the
    command line. </p>

    <p>The command line is a sequence of ASCII text words delimited by
    whitespace. The first word in the command line is either the name
    of a built-in command or the pathname of an executable file. The
    remaining words are command-line arguments. If the first word is a
    built-in command, the shell immediately executes the command in
    the current process. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be the
    pathname of an executable program. In this case, the shell forks a
    child process and then loads and runs the program in the context
    of the child. The child processes created as a result of
    interpreting a single command line are known collectively as
    a <em>job</em>.  In general, a job can consist of multiple child
    processes connected by Unix pipes. </p>

    <p>If the command line ends with an ampersand ”&amp;”,
    then the job runs in the <em>background</em>, which means that the
    shell does not wait for the job to terminate before printing the
    prompt and awaiting the next command line. Otherwise, the job runs
    in the <em>foreground</em>, which means that the shell waits for
    the job to terminate before awaiting the next command line. Thus,
    at any point in time, at most one job can be running in the
    foreground. However, an arbitrary number of jobs can run in the
    background. </p>

<p>For example, typing the command line:
</p><p><tt>msh&gt; jobs</tt> causes the shell to execute the built-in <tt>jobs</tt>
command. 
</p><p>
Typing the command line:
</p><p><tt>msh&gt; /bin/ls -l -d</tt> runs the <tt>ls</tt> program in the
foreground. By convention, the shell ensures that when this program
begins executing its main routine:
</p><p><tt>int main(int argc, char *argv[])</tt> the <tt>argc</tt>
and <tt>argv</tt> arguments have the following values: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
   <tt>argc == 3</tt>
</li>
<li>
    <tt>argv[0] == ‘‘/bin/ls’’</tt> 
</li>
<li>
    <tt>argv[1]== ‘‘-l’’</tt> 
</li>
<li>
    <tt> argv[2]== ‘‘-d’’ </tt>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, typing the command line </p>
<p><tt>msh&gt; /bin/ls -l -d &amp; </tt>runs the <tt>ls</tt> program
in the background. </p>

<p>Unix shells support the notion of <em>job control</em>, which
allows users to move jobs back and forth between background and
foreground, and to change the process state (running, stopped, or
terminated) of the processes in a job. Typing <tt>ctrl-c</tt> causes a
SIGINT signal to be delivered to each process in the foreground
job. The default action for SIGINT is to terminate the
process. Similarly, typing <tt>ctrl-z</tt> causes a SIGTSTP signal to
be delivered to each process in the foreground job. The default action
for SIGTSTP is to place a process in the stopped state, where it
remains until it is awakened by the receipt of a SIGCONT signal. When
a job is stopped or terminated, the user receives a message indicating
the state of the process and then a command prompt.

</p><p> Unix shells also provide various built-in commands that support
job control. These commands include: </p>
<ul>
<li><tt>jobs</tt>: List the running and stopped background jobs. 
</li>
<p>
</p><li> <tt>bg &lt;job&gt;</tt>: Change a stopped background job to a
running background job. 
</li>
<p>
</p><li><tt>fg &lt;job&gt;</tt>: Change a stopped or running background
job to a running in the foreground. 
</li>
<p>
</p><li><tt>kill &lt;job&gt;</tt>: Terminate a job. <p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p></p><h4>Getting Started</h4><p></p>
<p>We provide a file <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ans/classes/cs439/projects/shell_project/shproj-handout.tar"><tt>shproj-handout.tar</tt></a> that contains a
template for your program along with a number of useful helper
functions. Get it from the class web page by either using the command:</p>
<p>
<tt>unix&gt; wget
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ans/classes/cs439/projects/shell_project/shproj-handout.tar
</tt>
</p><p>
or downloading in a browser.
</p><p>
Put the file <tt>shproj-handout.tar</tt> to the protected directory
(the <em>project directory</em>) in which you plan to do your work.

Then do the following: 
</p><ol>
<li>Type the command <tt>tar xvf shproj-handout.tar</tt> to expand the tarfile.
<p>
Once the command has finished expanding the archive, you should find
the following files:
</p><pre>Files:

Makefile	# Compiles your shell program and runs the tests
README		# This file
msh.c		# A shell program that you will write and hand in
mshref		# The reference shell binary.

addresses at the top of the README file.
</li>
<p>
</p></ol>
<hr>
<p></p><h4>Part 0: fork/exec </h4><p></p>
<p>In this phase of the project, you will learn about the <tt>fork</tt> and
<tt>exec</tt> system calls that you will use in the rest of the project. </p>

<p></p><h5>Part 0.1: Reading</h5><p></p>
<p>Read every word of sections 3 and 4 of chapter 8 of Bryant and
O’Hallaron. Also, read every word of this handout before you
write any code. </p>

<p></p><h5>Part 0.2: Fibonacci </h5><p></p>
<p>Update fib.c so that if invoked on the command line with some
integer argument <tt>n</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is less than or equal to
13, it recursively computes the
nth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci
number</a>. (The numbers are counted from 0.) </p>
<p>Example executions:
</p><pre>unix&gt; fib 3 
2 
unix&gt; fib 10 
55
</pre>

<p> The trick is that each recursive call must be made by a new
process, so you will call <tt>fork()</tt> and then have the new child process
call <tt>doFib()</tt>. </p>

<p>The parent must wait for the child to complete, and the child must
pass the result of its computation to its parent.
</p><p>
You may modify <tt>doFib()</tt>, but you may not modify the number of
parameters it accepts or its return value.


</p><p></p><h5>Part 0.3: Fork/Exec </h5><p></p>

<p>The <tt>fork</tt> system call creates a child process that is nearly
identical to the parent. The <tt>exec</tt> call replaces the state of the
currently running process with a new state to start running a new
program in the current process. </p>

<p>Your job is to create a prototype of the shell you will be creating
in Part 2. 

</p><p>We have provided psh.c, which provides framework for your shell,
and util.h/util.c which provides some helper functions. Read these
files. </p>

<p>This prototype waits for a line of input. If the line is
“quit”, it exits. Otherwise, it parses the line and
attempts to execute the program at the path specified by the first
word with the arguments specified by the remaining words. It waits for
that job to finish. Then it waits for the next line of input. </p>


<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The prompt should be the string <tt>psh&gt;</tt>. </p>
</li>
<p>
  </p><li>
    <p>The command line typed by the user should consist of a name and
    zero or more arguments, all separated by one or more spaces. If
    name is a built-in command, then <tt>psh</tt> should handle it
    immediately and wait for the next command
    line. Otherwise, <tt>psh</tt> should assume that name is the path
    of an executable file, which it loads and runs in the context of a
    child process.  Your shell waits for that job to finish, and then
    it waits for the next line of input.  (In this context, the
    term <em>job </em> refers to this child process.)

</p><p>For example, </p>
<p><tt>psh&gt; /bin/ls -l -d </tt> </p><p> 

should run the <tt>ls</tt> program in the foreground. </p>

</li>
<p>
</p><li>
Your shell should implement one built-in command: <tt>quit</tt>. If
the user types <tt>quit</tt>, your shell should exit. <p></p>
</li>
<p></p><li>For now, all commands and jobs are executed in the foreground.
You also can assume that jobs execute until they exit; you don’t
need to worry about signal handling (again, for now). <p></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Update the file psh.c by implementing the
functions <tt>eval()</tt>, which the <tt>main()</tt> function calls to
process one line of input, and builtin <tt>cmd()</tt>, which
your <tt>eval()</tt> function should call to parse and process the
built-in <tt>quit</tt> command. (Later in this project, you will extend the
built-in command function to handle other built-in commands.) </p>

<p></p><h5>Hints for Part 0: fork/exec</h5><p></p>
<ul>
<li>
    The <tt>waitpid</tt>, <tt>fork</tt>, and <tt>exec*</tt> functions
    will come in very handy.  Use <tt>man</tt> to learn about them.
    (Remember, you can use <tt>man man</tt> to learn
    about <tt>man</tt>!)
</li>
<p>
</p><li> The <tt>WEXITSTATUS</tt> macro described in the <tt>waitpid</tt>
man page may also be useful.
</li>
<p>
</p><li> Recall that C does not have strings.  Read more about string
handling in C
in <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/notes/sx8.html">these
notes</a>.
</li>
<p>
</p></ul>

<p></p><h4>Part 1: Signal Handling</h4>
<p>
</p><h5>Part 1.1: Reading </h5><p></p>
<p>Read every word of section 5 of chapter 8 of Bryant and
O’Hallaron. Examine the code for the <tt>Signal()</tt> function in
util.c. </p>

<p></p><h5>Part 1.2: Signal Handling </h5><p></p>
<p>Write a program in handle.c that first uses the <tt>getpid()</tt>
system call to find its process ID, then prints that ID, and finally
loops continuously, printing “Still here\n” once every
second. Set up a signal handler so that if you hit <tt>ˆc</tt>
(<tt>ctrl-c</tt>), the program prints “Nice try.\n” to the
screen and continues to loop. </p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>The <tt>printf()</tt> function is technically unsafe
to use in a signal handler. A safer way to print the message is to
call:
</p><pre>ssize_t bytes; 
const int STDOUT = 1; 
bytes = write(STDOUT, "Nice try.\n", 10); 
if(bytes != 10) 
   exit(-999);
</pre>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You should use the <tt>nanosleep()</tt>
library call rather than the <tt>sleep()</tt> call so that you can
maintain your 1-second interval between “Still here”
messages no matter how quickly the user hits <tt>ˆc</tt>. </p>

<p>You can terminate this program using <tt>kill -9</tt>. For example, if the
process ID is 4321:
</p><p>
<tt> unix&gt; kill -9 4321 </tt>
</p><p>
Since <tt>handle</tt> has control of your current terminal window,
you'll need to execute the <tt>kill</tt> command from another window
on the same machine.
</p><p></p><h5>Part 1.3: Signal Sending </h5><p></p>

<p>Update the program from Part 1.2 to catch the SIGUSR1 signal, print
“exiting”, and exit with status equal to 1. </p>

<p>Now write a program mykill.c that takes a process ID as an argument
and that sends the SIGUSR1 signal to the specified process ID.  </p>
<p>For example:
</p><pre> 
unix&gt;./handle 
4321  
Still here  
Still here  
Still here                               unix&gt;./mykill 4321  
exiting                                  unix&gt;
unix&gt;
</pre>
The stub code is provided for you.

<p> </p><h5>Part 1.4: Signal Mechanics </h5><p></p>

<p> In this section, you will take a look at how signals are
implemented by inspecting the assembly code associated with your
program and with the signal call. There are questions in the design
document for you to answer regarding your program's behavior in the
presence of signals.

</p><p> If you compile a C program with the <tt>-S</tt> flag, the compiler outputs
the assembly language corresponding the the code it would generate for
the program. You can then use <tt>cat</tt> to view the output.
</p><p>For example: </p>
<pre>unix&gt; gcc -S handle.c 
unix&gt; cat handle.s 
...
</pre>
<p>
</p><p> In the gdb debugger, you can see the assembly code for a function.
First, recompile your program using the following commands: </p>
<pre>gcc -Wall -g   -c -o handle.o handle.c
gcc -Wall -g handle.o util.o -o handle
</pre>
(Note that these commands assume that <tt>util.o</tt> exists.  If you receive an
error saying that it doesn't exist, run <tt>make</tt> first and then re-execute
the above commands.)
<p>
Then execute <tt>gdb</tt> as follows:
</p><pre>unix&gt; gdb handle 
(gdb) disassemble main 
Dump of assembler code for function main: 
0x0000000100000970 <main+0>: push %rbp 
0x0000000100000971 <main+1>: mov %rsp,%rbp 
0x0000000100000974 <main+4>: push %r12 
0x0000000100000976 <main+6>: push %rbx 
... 
</main+6></main+4></main+1></main+0></pre>
<p>In gdb, you can set a <em>breakpoint</em> for a function.  A breakpoint
indicates a place where execution should stop so that you can inspect
its state. </p>

<pre>(gdb) break main 
Breakpoint 1 at 0x10000097b: file handle.c, line 30. 
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>You can then <tt>step</tt> to the next C/C++ instruction or <tt>stepi</tt> to the
next assembly instruction:
</p><pre>(gdb) run
Starting program: /u/ans/classes/cs439/projects/shproj/src/handle

Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0x7fff5fbff6e0) at handle.c:30 
30 int pid = getpid(); 
(gdb) step 
31 printf("%d\n", pid); 
(gdb) stepi
0x0000000100000989 31 printf("%d\n", pid); 
(gdb) stepi 
0x000000010000098b 31 printf("%d\n", pid); 
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>Now, use gdb to pass a particular signal to your program so that
you can understand what happens. You can tell gdb to pass a
particular signal to your program this way:</p>

<pre>(gdb) handle SIGUSR1 pass 
Signal   Stop  Print  Pass to program  Description 
SIGUSR1  Yes   Yes    Yes              User defined signal 1 
(gdb) handle SIGUSR1 nostop 
Signal   Stop  Print  Pass to program  Description 
SIGUSR1  No    Yes    Yes              User defined signal 1 
(gdb) <p></p>
</pre>
Note that <tt>handle</tt> here is a command to <tt>gdb&gt;</tt> and not a
reference to your program of the same name.  Also note that
it <i>passes</i> a signal sent to <tt>gdb</tt> on to the user process.
You'll need to send a signal from outside <tt>gdb</tt>.  You can read
more about signal handling in <tt>gdb</tt> in
this <a href="http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Documentation/Gnu/gdb-5.0/html_node/gdb_38.html">gdb
documentation</a>.

<p>Use these techniques to answer the questions in the design document
relating to signal mechanics (Part 1).

</p><hr>
<p></p><h4>Part 2: Shell </h4><p></p>

<p>In this phase of the project, you will implement a simple shell,
<tt>msh</tt>. Your msh shell should have the following features: </p>

<ul>
<li>  The prompt should be the string “msh&gt; ”. 
</li>
<p>
</p><li> The command line typed by the user should consist of a path to an
executable file, <tt>name</tt>, and zero or more arguments, all
separated by one or more spaces. If <tt>name</tt> is a built-in
command, then <tt>msh</tt> should handle it immediately and wait for
the next command line. Otherwise, <tt>msh</tt> should assume
that <tt>name</tt> is the path of an executable file, which it loads
and runs in the context of an initial child process. <!-- (In this context,
the term <em>job </em>refers to this initial child process).-->
</li>
<p>
</p><li>Typing <tt>ctrl-c</tt> or <tt>ctrl-z</tt> should cause a SIGINT or
    SIGTSTP signal, whichever is appropriate, to be sent to the
    current foreground job, <em>as well as any descendants of that
    job</em> (e.g., any child processes that it forked). If there is
    no foreground job, then the signal should have no effect. <p></p>
</li>
<p>
</p><li> If the command line ends with an ampersand (&amp;),
then <tt>msh</tt> should run the job in the background.  Otherwise, it
should run the job in the foreground.
</li>
<p>
</p><li> Each job can be identified by either a process ID (PID) or a job
ID (JID), which is a positive integer assigned by <tt>msh</tt>.  JIDs
should be denoted on the command line by the prefix
<tt>%</tt>. For example, <tt>%5</tt> denotes JID 5, and
<tt>5</tt> denotes PID 5. We have provided you with all of the
routines you need for manipulating the job list.
</li>
<p>
</p><li> <tt>msh</tt> should support the following built-in commands: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <tt>quit</tt> command terminates the shell.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <tt>jobs</tt> command lists all background jobs.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <tt>bg &lt;job&gt;</tt> command
        restarts <tt>&lt;job&gt;</tt> by sending it a SIGCONT signal,
        and then runs it in the background. The <tt>&lt;job&gt;</tt>
        argument can be either a PID or a JID.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <tt>fg &lt;job&gt;</tt> command
        restarts <tt>&lt;job&gt;</tt> by sending it a SIGCONT signal,
        and then runs it in the foreground. The <tt>&lt;job&gt;</tt>
        argument can be either a PID or a JID. <p></p>
    </li></ul>
  <p>
  </p></li><li> <tt>msh</tt> should reap all of its zombie children. If any job
  terminates because it receives a signal that it didn't catch, then
  <tt>msh</tt> should recognize this event and print a message with
  the job's PID and a description of the offending signal. <p></p>
</li>
<p>
</p><li>msh need not support pipes (|) or I/O redirection (&lt; and &gt;).
</li>
<p>
</p><li>
If a process is stopped or terminated by a signal, <tt>msh</tt> should print that information to the screen.  Such as:
<pre>Job [1] (26961) terminated by signal 2
Job [1] (26963) stopped by signal 20
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

Looking at the msh.c (<em>mini shell</em>) file, you will see that it
contains a functional skeleton of a simple Unix shell. To help you get
started, we have already implemented the less interesting
functions. Your assignment is to complete the remaining empty
functions listed below. As a sanity check for you, we've listed the
approximate number of lines of code for each of these functions in our
reference solution (which includes lots of comments).

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><tt>eval</tt>: Main routine that parses and interprets the command
    line. [70 lines] </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt>builtin_cmd</tt>: Recognizes and interprets the built-in commands:
    <tt>quit</tt>, <tt>fg</tt>, <tt>bg</tt>, and <tt>jobs</tt>. [25
    lines] </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt>do_bgfg</tt>: Implements the <tt>bg</tt> and <tt>fg</tt>
    built-in commands. [50 lines] </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt>waitfg</tt>: Waits for a foreground job to complete.  [20
    lines] </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt>sigchld_handler</tt>: Catches SIGCHILD signals. [80 lines] </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt>sigint_handler</tt>: Catches SIGINT (ctrl-c) signals.  [15
    lines] </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt>sigtstp_handler</tt>: Catches SIGTSTP (ctrl-z) signals.  [15
    lines] </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each time you modify your msh.c file, type <tt>make</tt> to
recompile it. To run your shell, type msh to the command line: </p>
<p>
    <tt>unix&gt; ./msh

    </tt></p><p><tt> msh&gt; <em>[type commands to your shell here] </em></tt>


 </p><p></p><h5>Hints for Part 2: Shell</h5> <p></p>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>
Use the trace files to guide the development of your shell. Starting
with trace01.txt, make sure that your shell produces
the <em>identical </em>output as the reference shell. Then move on to
trace file trace02.txt, and so on.
</li>
<p>
  </p><li>
    As in other portions of this project,
    the <tt>waitpid</tt>, <tt>kill</tt>, <tt>fork</tt>, <tt>execve</tt>, <tt>setpgid</tt>,
    and <tt>sigprocmask</tt> functions will be useful.  The WUNTRACED
    and WNOHANG options to <tt>waitpid</tt> will also be useful.
  </li>
  <p> 
  </p><li>
    Programs such as <tt>more</tt>, <tt>less</tt>, <tt>vi</tt>,
    and <tt>emacs</tt> do strange things with the terminal
    settings. Don't run these programs from your shell. Stick with
    simple text-based programs such
    as <tt>/bin/ls</tt>, <tt>/bin/ps</tt>, and
    <tt>/bin/echo</tt>.
  </li>
<p>
</p><li>
When you implement your signal handlers, be sure to send SIGINT and
SIGTSTP signals to the entire foreground process group, using
<tt>-pid</tt> instead of <tt>pid</tt> in the argument to the
<tt>kill</tt> function.  The sdriver.pl program tests for this error.
</li>
<p>
</p><li>
One of the tricky parts of the assignment is deciding on the
allocation of work between the <tt>waitfg</tt> and <tt>sigchld_handler</tt> functions.
We recommend the following approach: <p></p>
<ul>
<li>
  In <tt>waitfg</tt>, use a busy loop around the <tt>sleep</tt> function.
</li> 
<li>
  In <tt>sigchld_handler</tt>, use exactly one call to <tt>waitpid</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

    <p>While other solutions are possible, such as
calling <tt>waitpid</tt> in both <tt>waitfg</tt>
and <tt>sigchld_handler</tt>, these can be very confusing. It is
simpler to do all reaping in the handler.

    </p><p>Note that you probably can do something simpler for the
    prototype you build in part 1. Then, be ready to change how this
    works when you get to part 3. </p>
</li>
<p>
</p><li>
 In <tt>eval</tt>, the parent must use <tt>sigprocmask</tt> to block
 SIGCHLD signals before it forks the child, and then unblock these
 signals, again using <tt>sigprocmask</tt>, after it
 uses <tt>addjob</tt> to add the child to the job list.  Since
 children inherit the blocked vectors of their parents, the child must
 be sure to then unblock SIGCHLD signals before it execs the new
 program. 

    <p>The parent needs to block the SIGCHLD signals in this way in
    order to avoid the race condition where the child is reaped by
    <tt>sigchld_handler</tt> (and thus removed from the job
    list) <em>before </em>the parent calls <tt>addjob</tt>. </p>
</li>
<p>
</p><li>
    When you run your shell from the standard Unix shell, your shell
    is running in the foreground process group. If your shell then
    creates a child process, by default that child will also be a
    member of the foreground process group. Since
    typing <tt>ctrl-c</tt> sends a SIGINT to every process in the
    foreground group, typing <tt>ctrl-c</tt> will send a SIGINT to
    your shell, as well as to every process that your shell created,
    which obviously isn't the behavior we want.

    <p>Here is the workaround: After the fork, but before the exec,
    the child process should call <tt>setpgid(0, 0)</tt>, which puts
    the child in a new process group whose group ID is identical to
    the child's PID. This ensures that there will be only one process,
    your shell, in the foreground process group. When you
    type <tt>ctrl-c</tt>, the shell should catch the resulting SIGINT
    and then forward it to the appropriate foreground job (or more
    precisely, the process group that contains the foreground
    job). </p>

</li>
</ul>

<p></p><h4>Checking Your Work </h4><p></p>

<p>We have provided some tools to help you check your work. </p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Reference solution. </strong>The Linux
    executable <tt>mshref</tt>, which was included in the tarball you
    downloaded, is the reference solution for the shell.  Run this
    program to resolve any questions you have about how your shell
    should behave. <em>Your msh shell should emit output that is
    identical to the reference solution </em>(except for PIDs, of
    course, which change from run to run).

</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Shell driver. </strong>  The sdriver.pl program executes a
shell as a child process, sends it commands and signals as directed by
a <em>trace file, </em>and captures and displays the output from the
shell. 

</p><p>Use the <tt>-h</tt> argument to find out the usage of sdriver.pl:
</p><pre>unix&gt;./sdriver.pl -h
Usage: sdriver.pl [-hv] -t &lt;trace&gt; -s &lt;shellprog&gt; -a &lt;args&gt; 
Options: 
 -h            Print this message  
 -v            Be more verbose 
 -t &lt;trace&gt;    Trace file 
 -s &lt;shell&gt;    Shell program to test 
 -a &lt;args&gt;     Shell arguments 
 -g            Generate output for autograder 
</pre>

<p>We have also provided 16 trace files (trace{01-16}.txt) that you
should use in conjunction with the shell driver to test the
correctness of your shell. The lower-numbered trace files do very
simple tests, and the higher-numbered tests do more complicated
tests. </p>

<p>You can run the shell driver on your shell using trace file
trace01.txt (for instance) by typing: 
</p><pre>unix&gt; ./sdriver.pl -t trace01.txt -s ./msh -a "-p"
</pre>
 The <tt>-a "-p"</tt> argument tells your shell not to emit
a prompt. You could accomplish the same task with this command:
<pre>unix&gt; make test01
</pre>
<p>
Similarly, to compare your result with the reference shell, you can
run the trace driver on the reference shell by typing: </p>
<pre>unix&gt; ./sdriver.pl -t trace01.txt -s ./mshref -a "-p"
</pre>
or
<pre>unix&gt; make rtest01
</pre>

<p>For your reference, mshref.out gives the output of the reference
solution for all traces. <!--This might be more convenient for you than
manually running the shell driver on all trace files. </p>-->

</p><p>The neat thing about the trace files is that they generate the same
output you would have gotten had you run your shell interactively
(except for an initial comment that identifies the trace). For
example: </p>
<pre>unix&gt; make test15 
./sdriver.pl -t trace15.txt -s ./msh -a "-p" 
# 
# trace15.txt - Putting it all together 
# msh&gt; ./bogus 
./bogus: Command not found. 
msh&gt; ./myspin 10 
Job (9721) terminated by signal 2 
msh&gt; ./myspin 3 &amp; 
[1] (9723) ./myspin 3 &amp; 
msh&gt; ./myspin 4 &amp;
[2] (9725) ./myspin 4 &amp; 
msh&gt; jobs 
[1] (9723) Running ./myspin 3 &amp; 
[2] (9725) Running ./myspin 4 &amp; 
msh&gt; fg %1 
Job [1] (9723) stopped by signal 20 
msh&gt; jobs 
[1] (9723) Stopped ./myspin 3 &amp; 
[2] (9725) Running ./myspin 4 &amp; 
msh&gt; bg %3 
%3: No such job 
msh&gt; bg %1 
[1] (9723) ./myspin 3 &amp; 
msh&gt; jobs 
[1] (9723) Running ./myspin 3 &amp; 
[2] (9725) Running ./myspin 4 &amp; 
msh&gt; fg %1 
msh&gt; quit 
unix&gt;
</pre>

<p>
For tests 11 through 13, your output does not need to (and very likely
won't) match exactly.  For your program to be correct, the state(s)
of <tt>mysplit</tt> in your output must match exactly.
</p><p>
For tests 14 and 15, the PIDs listed in your output will likely differ
from those in the provided output. As long as that is all that
differs, your code will still be considered correct.

    <p></p><h3>On Programming and Logistics</h3><p></p>

The following guidelines should help smooth the process of delivering
your project. You can help us (and yourself!) a great deal by observing the
following:

<p></p><h4>General </h4><p></p>

<ol>
<li>
You <b>must</b> work in two-person teams on this project. Failure to
do so will result in a 0 for the project. Once you have selected a
partner:
<ol>
  <li> exchange first and last names, EIDs, and CS logins </li>
  <li> fill out the README distributed with the project</li>
  <li> register in Canvas as a Shell Group </li>
</ol>
You must follow
the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ans/classes/cs439/pairprogramming.html"> pair programming
guidelines </a> set forth for this class.</li>  <b>If you have trouble finding a
partner, you must notify the course staff no later than one week before the
project due date.</b>  We will then help you find a partner.
<p>
<b>Please see the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ans/classes/cs439/projects/GradingCriteria.html">Grading Criteria</a>
to understand how failure to follow the pair programming guidelines OR
fill out the README will affect your grade.</b>
</p><li> You must follow the guidelines laid out in
the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ans/classes/cs439/projects/CStyleGuide.html"> C Style Guide</a> or your will lose
points.  This includes selecting reasonable names for your files and
variables. </li>

<li> This project will be graded on the UTCS public linux
machines. Although you are welcome to do testing and development on
any platform you like, we cannot assist you in setting up other
environments, and you must test and do final debugging on the UTCS
public linux machines. The statement "It worked on my machine" will
not be considered in the grading process. </li>
<li>Your solution shell will be tested for correctness using the same
shell driver and trace files that are included in your project
directory. Your shell should produce <strong>identical</strong> output
on these traces as the reference shell, with only two exceptions: 
<ul>
<li> The PIDs can (and will) be different. 
</li>
<li> The output of the <tt>/bin/ps</tt> commands in trace11.txt,
trace12.txt, and trace13.txt will be different from run to
run. However, the running states of any mysplit processes in the
output of the <tt>/bin/ps</tt> command should be identical.
</li>
</ul>
We will grade your code by script, so any additional variations from the output
provided by the reference shell will result in a 0 for that portion of the assignment.
</li>
<li>
Your code <b>must</b> compile without any additions or adjustments, or
you will receive a 0 for the correctness portion.</li>

<li>
You are encouraged to reuse <i><font color="#990000">your
own</font></i> code that you might have developed in previous courses to
handle things such as queues, sorting, etc.</li>

<li>
You are also encouraged to use code provided by a public library such
as the GNU library.</li>

<li>You may not look at the written work of any student other than
your partner. This includes, for example, looking at another student's
screen to help them debug, looking at another student's print-out,
working with another student to sketch a high-level design on a
white-board. See the syllabus for additional details.</li>

<li>
If you find that the problem is under specified, please make
reasonable assumptions and document them in the README file.
Any clarifications or revisions to the assignment will be posted to
Piazza.</li>

</ol>

<p></p><h4>Submitting Your Work</h4><p></p>
<ol>
<li>
After you finish your code, please use <tt>make turnin</tt> to create a
compressed tarball for submission.  The filename format will be
&lt;username&gt;_shell_project.tar.gz.  Then, upload the .tar.gz file to the
<tt>Project 0 Correctness and Documentation</tt> assignment in Canvas.  <i>Only
one member of the pair should perform the upload.</i>  Make sure you have
included the necessary information in the README and placed your pair
programming log in the project directory.</li>
<li>
Once you have completed your design document (<b>each student should
        complete one individually</b>), please submit it to the <tt>Project 0
	Design</tt> assignment in Canvas.
 Make sure you have included your name, CS login, and UT EID in the design
        document.</li>
</ol>


<p></p><h4>Grading</h4><p></p>
<ol>
<p>
Code will be evaluated based on its correctness, clarity, and elegance
according to the
criteria <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ans/classes/cs439/projects/GradingCriteria.html">here</a>. Strive for
simplicity. Think before you code.
</p><p>
The most important factor in grading your code design and documentation will be code inspection
and evaluation of the descriptions in the write-ups. Remember, if your
code does not follow the standards, it is wrong. If your code is not
clear and easy to understand, it is wrong.
<!--<p>The second most important factor in grading your code will be an
analysis its correctness.-->
